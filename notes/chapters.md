Introduction

1. Research

   - Issues with data
   - Ways to solve that issue - preprocessing -> choose of operations

2. Architecture

   - performance testing of DataFrame libraries -> decision to use own solution
   - technologies - what it is and why have been chosen
      - React
      - Typescript + TSX
      - React Flow
      - Recoil
      - MUI
      - Styled components
      - (React Hook Form)
      - (Eslint, Prettier)

3. Analysis and design

   - Requirements
   - Use cases (diagram)
   - Data model (UML class diagram + description)

4. Implementation

   - node-base interface
   - setting node parameters, displaying data, downloading...
   - DataFrame and it's operations
   - state management, data flow and operation execution

5. Future improvements

   - performance -> WASM / client-server
   - more operations
   - more functions (views, ML)

6. Conclusion
